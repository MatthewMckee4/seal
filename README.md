# Seal

An extremely fast release management tool, written in Rust.

## What is Seal?

Seal unifies the release cycle into a single command.

## The Problem

Often release management is fragmented. Seal aims to solve this by providing one tool that handles the entire release cycle.

## Status

Early development - not yet functional

## Vision

Seal aims to make releases as simple as running a single command, with sensible defaults that work for most projects and clear configuration for those that need it.
